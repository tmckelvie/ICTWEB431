        <h1 class="arc-heading-centered">About Us</h1>
        <p class="asimovian-regular padding">Massive Games is a creative community of artists and game makers located in Mildura, Victoria, Australia. Massive Games started as a group of independent artists, writers, and game developers looking for a shared place to create and collaborate. In early 2013, our not-for-profit studio and collective was founded.</p>
        <p class="asimovian-regular padding">We're multi-disciplined with skills in multiple fields. Our projects are run independently, but may involve multiple members working together. Over time, we've grown into an event and community hub for the indie games community in the Mallee region of Australia.</p>
